# Learning Dependecies

## 17th November 2024
Today, I learned about **Linux**, **Windows OS**, and **Virtual Private Server**. 


### Key Takeaways
- **ParrotOS**: One of the most popular penetration testing distribution which I have installed andwill be using during this course.
- **tmux terminal emulator**: Installed on my VMware ParrotOS.
- **Note Taking**: Taking notes is a crucial part of cybersecurity. We accumulate a lot of details during investigations or penetration testing, and it's impossible to remember everything without proper documentation. 
- **Virtualization**: is an abstraction of physical computing recourses.  

### Reflections
I installed ParrotOS in a virtual environment using VMware Fusion. After completing the basic configurations, I set up and updated the repositories in the APT package manager, adding some additional ones as needed. However, I encountered an issue with the configuration of `tools.list` that I couldn't resolve. Despite attempting to troubleshoot, I'm still stuck and have decided to leave it for now. I'll revisit the problem once my Linux module begins.
