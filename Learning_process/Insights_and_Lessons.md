# Learning Dependecies

## 13th November 2024
Today, I learned about **network security basics**, including how firewalls and VPNs work. 

### Key Takeaways
- **Outside the box mindset**: An essential part of the *hacker mindset* to solve complex problem.
- **Importance of a Goal**: Without a goal, we move chaotically and are less motivated to complete tasks because we donâ€™t understand the purpose behind them.
- **Decision Making**: If we do not know what to do in one situation or another, the reason is usually that we have not gathered enough facts to make a good decision. 
- **The Relationship-Oriented-Questioning (ROQ) Model**: the model helps clarify what information is needed and how to connect the known and unknown elements of a situation. 

### Reflections
**Practical excersice:** *Write down the goal you want to achieve with this course as precisely as possible. Try to break it down and describe it in 500 words at most*

2. It will help me understand the essential tools and technologies needed to perform effectively in a SOC Analyst role.
3. It will enable me to pursue the job I have always aspired to have.
4. I will be able to demonstrate my knowledge and skills confidently in the workplace.

9. It will provide more opportunities to grow into advanced and complex career paths.
10. I will have the chance to work on interesting projects, in various industries, and for reputable companies.

**Exercise:** *Collect as much information as possible about the "Learning Pyramid" and create an overview of it. Analyze your research process and document it. We will need it later.*
"Learning Pyramid" shows that active learning methods are generally more effective than passive ones. It showns as a Pyramid where on the top:
1. The most lowest effective learning method - Lecture, where the learner passively listens to information with the lowest retention rate 5%. 
2. Reading - the retention rate 10%, where we use textbooks, article or any reading materials. It is slightly more effective but still involve passive learning. 
3. Audio-visual - the retention tare is 20%. Watching videos or engaging with multimedia content, like animations or diagrams, increses retention slightly. 
4. Demonstration - the retention tare is 30%. Seeing a demonstration of a concept or skill can enhance understanding and retention. 
5. Discussion Group - the retention tare is 50%. Engaging in discussions with peers helps learners to articulate their understanding and learn from others. 
6. Practice by doing - the retention tare is 75%. Hand-on practice or performing tasks related to the learning material greatly improves retention. 
7. Teachin Others - the retention tare is 90%. Teachin or explaining material to someone else is the most effective method, as requires a deep understanding of the topic. 

**The Relationship-Oriented_Questioning (ROQ) Model:** This model helps undertand how questions relate to different components of a proble:
1. Your position: your perspective of what you already know.
2. The Object: The main subject of your question (e.g., a system or concept).
3. Known Information: What you already know about the object. 
4. Unknown Information: What you don't know and want to discover. 
5. Other Positions: Perspectives of other people involved (if relevant).
*Practical Steps to Apply the ROQ Model:* Identify a Situation, Break it Down, Formulate Precise Questions, Adjust If Necessary (If the question doesn't lead to actionable answers, rephrase it to make it more specific)
